                        I'd describe myself as someone who is motivated, committed and ambitious. I believe in team-work and collaboration, for the simple reason that working in a team with a collaborative spirit is important when the need arises. Interity and authenticity are important to me. I do what I can to continue to improve and be the best I can be at whatever I do. I am accountable and I believe by taking responsibility for my actions and results, I have the ability to make the choices necessary for a better outcome or results the next time around. I don't let tough decisions control me. Insttead, I evaluate  them and decide the best way to approach the situation for the best results. I am hardworking and set reasonable goals fro myself. Once those are in place, I can then back out of them and create smaller goals to accomplish so I can continuously evaluate my performance. I strive to do my best I can for whatever task is presented to me.
